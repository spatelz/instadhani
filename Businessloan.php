                                        might have to increase production by investing in equipment and machinery with
                                        the latest technology. Furthermore, a company might also need to buy equipment
                                        during an expansion. Business loans are a great way to meet credit needs during
                                        such a situation.

                                        It is difficult for small companies to ensure there is a healthy amount of cash
                                        flow within the organisation. Therefore, a business might face a shortage of
                                        money to fulfil its liquidity requirements for a working capital such as utility
                                        bills, overhead salary, inventory management, rent, etc. However, this problem
                                        can be solved if a business owner opts for a loan to meet the company’s
                                        temporary financial crisis.

                                        When the cash flow is low within an organisation due to reasons such as market
                                        boom and increase in operating cycles, it is difficult to manage regular
                                        expenses such as salaries, supplies, and raw materials. In order to keep the
                                        business running and to recover from such a financial crisis, an entrepreneur
                                        might decide to avail a business loan and keep the business operational.

                                    </p>

                                        A business loan can also be availed to receive the funds required in order to
                                        make a business that has been incurring losses profitable. Even though many
                                        lenders are sceptical when funding a less successful/unsuccessful business,
                                        corporate applicants with a practical plan that includes major changes in
                                        business operations or introduction of a new product might convince them to do
                                        so.

                                        It is always a smart move to repay multiple small debts using a large loan in
                                        order to avoid paying a huge amount of money as interest. A businessman can also
                                        choose to do the same by availing a business loan.

                                        If you are operating a business that is in demand only during a certain time of
                                        the year then it might be difficult for you to manage the expenses when the
                                        orders start rushing in. In that case, you can secure a short-term business loan
                                        to offer undisrupted service to your customers and can repay the loan using the
                                        profit earned after the peak season is over.

                                    A few types of business loans are as follows:

                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                        Overdraft facility

                                    </li>
                                    <p>
                                        In an overdraft facility, the business owner can withdraw a larger sum than the
                                        amount present in the account as a loan to meet his or her business needs. The
                                        maximum amount that can be withdrawn and the interest rate under this facility
                                        is based on a mutual agreement between the lender and borrower.

                                    </p>
                                    <li>
                                        Term loans

                                    </li>
                                    <p>
                                        In case of a term loan, a borrower can avail a secured or unsecured loan to
                                        receive the funds according to the situation and requirement of the business.
                                        These loans are helpful in acquiring long-term assets. There are three types of
                                        term loans based on tenure namely short-term loan, long-term loan, and
                                        intermediate loan that can be repaid on a monthly or quarterly basis. While the
                                        rate of interest for such loans can be fixed or floating, it varies according to
                                        the loan repayment tenure.

                                        When an entrepreneur withdraws a demand loan to meet the financial requirements
                                        of his or her business, the amount has to be repaid whenever the bank or
                                        non-banking financing company (NBFC) recalls it. Demand loans can be both
                                        secured and unsecured and are ideal to meet a short-term financial crisis. While
                                        the maximum term for this type of a business loan can be 12 months, the merchant
                                        can choose to renew it when the term has ended.

                            <h3>Features and Benefits of Loan Against Property
                            </h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Low rate of interest: </strong>Secured loans usually have a lower rate of
                                    interest when compared to unsecured loans. In addition to that, if you have a good
                                    credit score and credit history, the chances of you getting a loan at a low rate of
                                    interest goes up.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Simple documentation and approval process: </strong>The process of
                                    documentation and approval of loans is generally simple when it comes to a loan
                                    against property. The property against which the loan is availed acts as collateral
                                    in this case. This allows lenders to go forward with an easy documentation process.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Flexibility in repayment of the loan: </strong> Most loans against property
                                    offers a flexible loan repayment tenure. On the basis of the lender that you choose,
                                    you can avail a loan repayment tenure of as long as 20 years.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Continuous ownership of the property: </strong>In case of a loan against
                                    property, the ownership of the property is retained with the borrower. When you
                                    offer your property as a collateral for a loan, the ownership does not change. This
                                    also allows you to sell the property in case you are unable to repay the loan.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Availability of pre-closure option: </strong>You have the option to
                                    pre-close your loan against property if you wish to do the same. If the loan that
                                    you have availed comes with a variable interest rate, you will not be required to
                                    pay any penalties for the pre-closure of the loan. However, you will be required to
                                    pay a nominal amount if your loan was on fixed interest rate.

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Optimal utilisation of the property: </strong>In case you avail a loan and
                                    you have a property which you offer as a collateral, you get to satisfy your
                                    financial needs with the loan amount which will be at par with the property. At the
                                    same time, you also get to retain your property. You can decide to not sell your
                                    property and still avail enough money to meet your requirements that too at
                                    affordable rates of interest.

                                    <p style="display: block;">A personal loan is an unsecured loan, typically with a
                                        tenure of 1-5 years. These are given without guarantors, asset hypothecation or
                                        collateral, and have a variety of potential lenders ranging from banks and NBFCs
                                        to P2P lending platforms. Loan amounts tend to be capped due to the lack of
                                        asset collateral.

                                        Am I eligible for a personal Loan?

                                        <i class="bx bx-plus"></i>
                                        <i class="bx bx-minus two"></i>

                                    <p>There are certain factors that determine your eligibility for a personal loan.
                                        First, your place of employment tends to be categorized into 3 tranches, A, B or
                                        C. If, say, you work at a reputed multinational company, your eligibility is
                                        likely to be rated high. Second, your liabilities and obligations count as a
                                        risk for banks. If your total EMI obligation on existing loans, like a home
                                        loan, exceed 50-75% of your net salary, a lender will not be willing to
                                        underwrite an additional liability. Third, your gross and net salary determines
                                        your capacity to repay and therefore has a disproportionate impact on both your
                                        eligibility as well as your interest rate.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Finally, your credit score is the primary check that banks use to ascertain your
                                        creditworthiness. A credit score below 600 automatically raises red flags,
                                        reduces the number of lenders willing to take on your case, and increases the
                                        interest rate of your loan as a risk premium for lenders.

                                    <p>If you are applying for a personal loan, then your application must follow a few
                                        standard protocols. They are eligibility checks, credit score checks,
                                        documentation, verification, approval, and disbursement. Every lender has their
                                        own time frame that they take to approve a personal loan. After submitting your
                                        application along with your documents, it might take as many as 7 days to get
                                        your loan approval and a couple of days more for disbursement.

                                        How are personal loan EMIs calculated?

                                        <i class="bx bx-minus two"></i>

                                    <p>Your personal loan EMI, or equated monthly installment, is calculated using two
                                        parts, an interest payment and a part payment of your principal. You only pay
                                        interest on your outstanding balance. So this means that even though you pay the
                                        same EMI each month, it comprises an increasingly larger proportion of interest
                                        repayment and decreasing amount of interest. This ensures that by the end of
                                        your tenure, you have completely paid off your loan and have zero outstanding
                                        balance on your loan amount.
